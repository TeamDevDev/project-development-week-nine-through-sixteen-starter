TODO: Answer all of the following questions in the specified fashion. Please
note that, in addition to ensuring that your GitHub repository has a passing
build, the course instructor will also confirm that you have adequately answered
all of the questions by providing meaningful responses to each of them.

TODO: Please note that you are invited to provide responses to all of these
questions as a part of your **Project Development** grade in this course.
It is important to note that if you do not provide satisfactory answers to all
of these questions you will not earn a satisfactory grade for one or more parts
of the assessment of your work in the project development category.

## Project Assessment

### Summary Checklist

TODO: Please create a filled checkbox for each project development task that you completed:

- [] Reviewed one or more pull requests in the GitHub repository for the project
- [] Created one or more pull requests in the GitHub repository for the project
- [] Discussed one or more pull requests in the GitHub repository for the project
- [] Made commits to a pull request that was ultimately merged to the main trunk
- [] Discussed one or more issues in the GitHub repository for the project
- [] Created one or more issues in the GitHub repository for the project
- [] Participated in the demonstration of a feature during a laboratory session
- [] Participated in the class discussions about project development
- [] Completed all of the documentation and reflection tasks in this document

### Project Development Reflection

#### Explain one project task that you have undertaken and that illustrates the distinction between programming and software engineering

TODO: Please provide a one paragraph response to this question.

#### Describe one software engineering task that you could not complete before taking the course but can successfully complete now

TODO: Please provide a one paragraph response to this question.

#### Knowing what you do now about project development, what advice would you give to yourself at the start of the academic semester?

TODO: Please provide a one paragraph response to this question.

#### Project Contributions

TODO: You must provide a response to each of the following prompts by providing
a list of the five most recent GitHub issues or pull requests that you created,
bearing in mind that you may provide additional items at your discretion.

##### Issue Tracker

TODO: Please provide a list of the five most recent GitHub issues that you created:

TODO: Please provide a list of the five most recent GitHub issues for which you participated in the discussion:

TODO: Please provide a list of the five most recent GitHub issues for which you helped to resolve the problem:

##### Pull Requests

TODO: Please provide a list of the five most recent GitHub pull requests that you created:

TODO: Please provide a list of the five most recent GitHub pull requests for which you participated in the discussion:

TODO: Please provide a list of the five most recent GitHub pull requests for which you made a major contribution:

TODO: Please provide a list of your five most recent GitHub pull requests that were merged to the project's main trunk:

##### Project Commits

TODO: Please report the number of commits that you made to a pull request that
were ultimately merged to the main/master trunk branch of the project.
Importantly, you should only report the count of commits that were merged into
the main/master trunk branch of the project. This means that you cannot count
commits that were made to a branch for a pull request but not yet merged during
the week range for this specific project development assessment. You should
report the total number of commits over the course of the entire semester.

I make `X` commits to main/master trunk branch of the long-term software project.

##### Project Leadership

TODO: Please summarize the ways in which you served as a leader of the project.
Your response to this question should summarize your leadership role in at least
three sentences. If you do not think that you served in a leadership role then
you should summarize what role you played and then further explain why you did
not serve in a leadership role during the development of the projects.

## Project Implementation

### Feature Description

TODO: Using your own words, please provide a one to three sentence description
of a feature that you have added to the tool during any phase of the project.

TODO: Your response to this prompt should explain a feature that you have not
previously described in any prior project reflections.

TODO: Bearing in mind the previous restriction, your response to this prompt
should, if possible, explain the most "complex" feature that you implemented.

### Command Execution and Output

TODO: Provide output in a fenced code block to illustrate how you would
demonstrate the aforementioned feature of the tool on your laptop. Your
response should also provide the command that you executed in an additional
fenced code block. Please label both code blocks so that their identify is clear.

- Fenced code block for the command that you executed

TODO: provide a fenced code block for the output of the command that you executed

- Fenced code block for the output of the command that you executed

TODO: Provide a fenced code block that contains the output from the execution of
the command in the previous fenced code block.

### Source Code Segment

TODO: Pick one example of a source code segment found in one of the course projects.
Your response to this question should furnish an input to a Python function, the
output of the Python function when provided with the input, and the source code
of the Python function itself. Your response to this question should also walk
through the lines of the source code in detail, demonstrating your understanding
of all the technical software engineering details associated with this source code.
Your response to this question must contain a fenced code block with
the Python source code that you found in the project's GitHub repository.

TODO: Please do not pick the same source code example that you selected during
any prior reflection on your contributions to a long-term software project.

### Overall Project Assessment

TODO: Please provide an overall assessment of the status of one of the long-term
projects. Your response to this prompt should address at least three questions
such as: how reliable is the project? How complete is the project? How
well-tested is the project? How maintainable is the project? How secure is the
project? How likely is it that the project will be used for unethical purposes?
